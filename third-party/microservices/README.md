# Hipster Shop: Cloud-Native Microservices Demo Application

This project contains a 10-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based e-commerce app called **“Hipster Shop”** where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.

## Service Architecture

**Hipster Shop** is composed of many microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

| Service                                              | Language      | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [frontend](./src/frontend)                           | Go            | Exposes an HTTP server to serve the website. Does not require signup/login and generates session IDs for all users automatically. |
| [cartservice](./src/cartservice)                     | C#            | Stores the items in the user's shopping cart in Redis and retrieves it.                                                           |
| [productcatalogservice](./src/productcatalogservice) | Go            | Provides the list of products from a JSON file and ability to search products and get individual products.                        |
| [currencyservice](./src/currencyservice)             | Node.js       | Converts one money amount to another currency. Uses real values fetched from European Central Bank. It's the highest QPS service. |
| [paymentservice](./src/paymentservice)               | Node.js       | Charges the given credit card info (mock) with the given amount and returns a transaction ID.                                     |
| [shippingservice](./src/shippingservice)             | Go            | Gives shipping cost estimates based on the shopping cart. Ships items to the given address (mock)                                 |
| [emailservice](./src/emailservice)                   | Python        | Sends users an order confirmation email (mock).                                                                                   |
| [checkoutservice](./src/checkoutservice)             | Go            | Retrieves user cart, prepares order and orchestrates the payment, shipping and the email notification.                            |
| [recommendationservice](./src/recommendationservice) | Python        | Recommends other products based on what's given in the cart.                                                                      |
| [adservice](./src/adservice)                         | Java          | Provides text ads based on given context words.                                                                                   |

## Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for
  Desktop", as well as on the cloud with GKE).
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to
  communicate to each other.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io):** Application works on Istio service mesh.
- **[OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/) Tracing:** Most services are
  instrumented using OpenCensus trace interceptors for gRPC/HTTP.
- **[Stackdriver APM](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/):** Many services
  are instrumented with **Profiling**, **Tracing** and **Debugging**. In
  addition to these, using Istio enables features like Request/Response
  **Metrics** and **Context Graph** out of the box. When it is running out of
  Google Cloud, this code path remains inactive.
